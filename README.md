# FireEmblem_Remake
A remake of my favorite childhood game
FIRE EMBLEM GAME SMALL TUTORIAL

Action key == a
Back Button == s
Movement/Navigation == Arrow Keys

To auto select a new ally player == q
To view stats on player == select with a, then press "Items"
To view growth rates of player == go into Items and press q
	- this also shows weapon masteries

Any player can use any weapon in the game, however each player starts
with a mastery score under a particular item, giving them boosted stats with that item type
If you wish to relearn their mastery, begin training with a new item as quickly as possible
There is no weapon triangle installed yet

If you move to a tile and wish to return back to where you were before,
perss the back button on the player and it will return him to the previous position
ONLY if you have not attacked or used items yet on the square you recently moved to.
This is great if you wish to see the damage/stats you have against an enemy, but not 
commit to moving there 100%.

In the HUD in the top left corner there will be a description of the Chapter Goal
Size = sieze the throne (stand on it and press Sieze)
Route = route the enemies
Survive = survive the allotted time (typically 11 turns)

Press ESCAPE key to navigate back to main menu

No need to edit the chapters with the Chapter Designer, but you can if you wish.
When the real version is released that option will not appear unless you
sign in as a developer
